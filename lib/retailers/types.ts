// Normalized retailer shape for the Find GSX locator.
//
// This is intentionally decoupled from Sanity's `dispensary` document shape
// (sanity/schemas/dispensary.ts) so the locator UI (map, result list, search)
// never depends on CMS field names directly. Swapping the data source later
// (real Sanity documents replacing lib/retailers/catalog.ts's dev data) means
// updating the mapper in lib/retailers/getRetailers.ts only — no UI changes.
//
// Deliberately excludes anything that would read as a store-level inventory
// signal (e.g. Sanity's `availabilityStatus` or `featuredProducts` fields) —
// the Find GSX page identifies retailers that carry GSX, it does not claim
// per-store or per-SKU stock. See lib/retailers/getRetailers.ts for how
// `availabilityStatus` is used to filter, not to display.
